# Forward_Kinematics_using_ML
Project-To help to predict how precise a robotic arm (IRB 120) can move.

To reach the most appropriate model, we tried three different models, the first LSTM, the second one was FNN network architecture, and the third one was sequential neural networks, we found out that the third one was the most appropriate way to create a prediction of the model around it. 

Apart from that, there are three different files for the code:
1) Loading data: if you want to see how to load such data for kinematics and robotics applications, you can use the source code.
2) EDA and correction: the second file would help you in EDA of such files and to process data according to need.
3) Main: this one shows all the models trained and the best model for the forward kinematics.

The project lacks some mathematical training, which means we still need to validate this mathematically to use it further to calculate the inverse kinematics. If you are working on it, or want to work on it, Please contact me exactly.mishra@gmail.com 

Note: the dataset is produced with a program which generates random number in performing range of IRB 120.
